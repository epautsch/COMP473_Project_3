To test our implementations, you can run the PatternsMain file.

Here is a brief description of the problems we solved using patterns:

1) BridgePattern: We used this pattern to separate the abstraction of
an F1 Car from the implementation of Tire. Both F1Car and Tire have 
different hierarchies which should have no impact on each other, thus
making this pattern the perfect pattern to solve the problem.

2) ObserverPattern: We used this pattern to allow for several 
Subscribers (the Observers in our problem) to attach, detach, and
receive updates from a Newspaper (the Subject in our problem).

3) VisitorPattern: We used this pattern to allow a CartVisitor to
visit different Items that might be found in a shopping cart
at the grocery store. The CartVisitor allowed us to make calculations
on each particular Item through its accept() method, thus moving the
operational logic away from the objects and into the CartVisitor class.
